First Real Java Project

Key Takeways:
-Planning
-OOP
-Structuring 
-Reading and Writing Files 
-File Directory
-User Loop Input System

IMPORTANT Realization: 
Instead of having each book based a name in the file directory, each book should have been assigned a unique ID and that ID would be used to save the book in the file directory. The title should have then been stored in the text file. This would make it so that we could save a book with the same name inside the file, each with their own unique saved ID.
